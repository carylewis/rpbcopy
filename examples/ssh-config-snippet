# Optional: Add a LocalCommand to auto-start rpbcopy-listen when you SSH somewhere.
# This ensures the listener is always running when you need it.

Host *
    # Uncomment to auto-start the listener on every SSH connection:
    # PermitLocalCommand yes
    # LocalCommand rpbcopy-listen --daemon 2>/dev/null

# If you prefer to limit it to specific hosts:
# Host devbox staging production
#     PermitLocalCommand yes
#     LocalCommand rpbcopy-listen --daemon 2>/dev/null
